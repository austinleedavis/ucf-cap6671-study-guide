# Abstract

Automated planning technology has become mature enough to be useful in applications that range from game playing to control of space vehicles. In this article, Dana Nau discusses where automated-planning research has been, where it is likely to go, where he thinks it should go, and some major challenges in getting there. The article is an updated version of Nauâ€™s invited talk at AAAI-05 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

# Analysis
Summarized status of automated-planning research.

## Three conceptual models
Outlines three conceptual models for #planning either offline, online, or with a separate scheduler:

## Types of planners
- **Domain-specific**: tailor-made for a given domain (includes **most** deployed planners)
- **Domain-independent**: sole input is description of planning problem.
- **Domain-configurable**: this type includes:
	- #HTN planners: O-plan SIPE-2 and SHOP2. 
	- control-rule planners: TLPlan and TALplanner


## Domain Independent planning
most focuses on #classical-planning  and the assumptions from [[Lecture 03#Classical Planning Assumptions]]. 

### Classical Planning Algorithms
- Plan-space planning: #UCPOP
- Planning Graphs: #graphplan and its many derivatives (ref: page 49-50 of [[nau-planning.pdf]])
- State-space planning: #HSP and #FastForward
	- Requires a good heuristic function derived from a relaxation of the problem


## Domain-configurable planners
### HTN Planners

Planning proceeds by decomposing tasks into subtasks, subtasks into subsubtasks, and so forth in a recursive manner until the planner reaches primitive tasks as in from [[nau-planning.pdf]]
