# Summary
A review of the open research challenges for Human Agent Collectives (HACs) of which there are four focus areas: 1.) flexible autonomy, 2.) agile teaming, 3.) incentive engineering, and 4.) accountable information infrastructure.

# Analysis
I'm reminded of walking through my home with my dog Star around. Before our paths crossed, I would see the dog coming and adjust my steps accordingly, but the dog, seeing me coming, would adjust his path. Inevitably, his adjustment would lead him right where my foot was going to land, and I would stumble, and my stumbling would panic the dog who would yelp and scurry away. 

This also reminds me of the CSCW work we did at DIU with CalFire, using multispectral satellite imagery to classify areas as active, disaster, and at-risk in order to best coordinate response efforts.

The need for a HAC to adapt gracefully to changes in the environment and varying levels of trustworthiness reminds.
