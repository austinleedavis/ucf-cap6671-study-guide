# Summary
Rodney Brooks believes the AI Singularity is not an event but a (possibly current) time period wherein humans an machines intertwine and integrate in a symbiotic relationship. He seems to support the idea that a hip replacement, ear implants (and perhaps cell phone usage) are initial steps on that path. He envisions a world like the Jetsons, where a team of Rosey the robots is responsible for the daily house chores. He also believes that the emotions such a robot exhibits should be treated as if they are real.

# Analysis
There are several issues with Brooks' view of the future:
1. He presents no consideration of the economics to maintain an army of helper robots. The hardware alone would likely be prohibitively expensive, let alone the fact that one still has to maintain and store the robot.
2. Once these robots do have sentience, can/should they be compelled to do menial duties around the house or within our society?
3. What motivation will these robots have to perform their duties? Marvin from the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*: "Here I am with a brain the size of a planet and they ask me to pick up a piece of paper. Call that job satisfaction? I don't."
4. He ignores the social stigma attached to body modification. While things like tattoos have been a part of society for millennia, #biohacking is an entirely new trend. Many draw an ethical line separating restorative medicine (e.g.,  a hip *replacement*) and the practices of #transhumanism or techno-progressivism.
