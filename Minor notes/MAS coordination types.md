# Summary
There are a multitude of ways that agents can work together.

- **Teamwork**: Agents share a common set of goals and each contributes to the fulfillment of these goals through teamwork. No explicit modeling of individual agent utility
- **Coalitions**: Agents seek to maximize individual utility and group utility (
	- Coalition stability is an issue: An agent works with the coalition as long as its advantageous, but can abandon the coalition if it finds better prices (advantage) elsewhere
	- This is not adversarial. 
	- Common during price negotiations: 
- **Coordination**: Agents pursue their individual goals and utilities; coordination with others is done only to avoid harmful interactions (e.g. traffic) 
- **Negotiation**: Agents seek to maximize their individual utility but are willing to compromise (i.e. better off if they reach agreement than not) 
- **Game Theoretic Interactions**: Agents seek to maximize individual utility while taking into consideration otherâ€™s options/perceptions 
- **Adversarial Interactions/Zero Sum Games**: Agents seek to maximize own utility while minimizing utility of opponent
