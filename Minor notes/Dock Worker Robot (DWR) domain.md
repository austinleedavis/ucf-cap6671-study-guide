A State Transition System $\Sigma = (S,A,E,g)$ consists of:
- S = {states}
- A = {actions}
- E = {exogenous events}
- $\gamma: S\times(A\cup E)$: State-transition function

DWR domain is pictured below. The DWR State Transition System is as follows:
- $S = \{s_0, â€¦, s_5\}$
- $A = \{move1, move2,put, take, load, unload\}$
- $E = \{\}, i.e., there are no exogenous events
- $\gamma:$ *see the arrows in diagram below*
