[[Lecture 18 (part 2) End of Course Summary|<<prev]] | [[README|next>>]]

The following sections come from Lecture 18 (Recording available on [Zoom (ucf.edu)](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1422160/external_tools/305492)), where Gita gave a review for the Final Exam. The markdown below was initially created based on Gita's slides.

When you see a topic/algorithm in **bold**, that topic will very likely have a workout problem on the Final Exam.


# Admin
## Announcements
- Class cancelled on Mon
- Grades released for the RLAgent assignments and Presentations
- Final projects
- 1 week extension possible but I recommend that you finish by this weekend.
- Final exam to be given as an open book timed Webcourses quiz
- 3 hours in duration
- To be taken some time between Apr 26 - 29
- Make sure that you have a good internet connection since I donâ€™t allow exam retakes. 2


## Exam Material
- No material on ROS
- No material from the student presentations.
- Everything else (assignments, papers, and lecture notes) is fair game
- **Most of the focus will be on the lecture notes** but since this is open book I will ask a few detailed questions about the papers!


## Exam Format
- To be made available as a webcourses quiz.
- Can be taken between Apr 26 - 29
- Open book but no collaboration with other people!
- No ChatGPT usage
- Short answer (3-4 sentences) about a specific point in the paper
- You will have to understand how the algorithms and systems work; you will be expected be specific
- Minimal math required


## Example Question
- How does a plan differ from a policy? (**supplement your answer with definitions and examples**)
	- Answer: "A policy is a mapping between states and actions (a universal plan). A plan is one specific, temporal ordering of actions. A plan in the dock worker robots domain would be pick up crate X, put it on pad B, etc." -Gita
